**Project Type:** The 14th National Software Innovation Contest  
**Duration:** May 2022 – Sep 2022  
**Award:** **National Third Prize**  
**Role:** Software R&D and Algorithm Design

## Overview

This project developed an innovative Augmented Reality (AR) application that enables users to share and view stories on iconic objects through AR technology. The system combines visual image feature recognition with GPS positioning to achieve semantic recognition and positioning of objects in the surrounding environment.

## Key Contributions

### AR Application Development

Developed a complete **Augmented Reality (AR) application** using ARCore that:

- Allows users to attach and share stories to physical objects
- Enables real-time viewing of AR content overlaid on recognized objects
- Provides an intuitive user interface for content creation and interaction

### Algorithm Design

Implemented advanced **semantic recognition and positioning algorithms**:

- **Visual Feature Recognition:** Developed algorithms for recognizing objects based on visual image features
- **GPS-assisted Positioning:** Integrated GPS positioning as auxiliary information to improve recognition accuracy
- **Multi-modal Fusion:** Combined visual and location data for robust object identification

## Technical Approach

The system leverages:

- **ARCore** for AR tracking and rendering
- **Computer vision** algorithms for feature extraction and matching
- **GPS integration** for spatial context
- **Mobile app development** for cross-platform deployment

## Achievement

**National Third Prize** in The 14th National Software Innovation Contest, recognizing the project's innovation in combining AR technology with semantic understanding of the physical world.

## Impact

This project demonstrates the potential of AR technology for creating location-aware, context-rich digital experiences that bridge the physical and digital worlds, with applications in tourism, education, and social interaction.
