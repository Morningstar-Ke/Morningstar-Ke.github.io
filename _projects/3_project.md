**Project Type:** National-level Outsourced Project  
**Duration:** Jan 2022 – May 2023  
**Role:** Undergraduate Sub-project Leader  
**Technologies:** Compiler Principles, Graph Algorithms, VHDL/Verilog

## Overview

This project involved developing a comprehensive code rule checker for FPGA hardware description languages (VHDL and Verilog) with an innovative circuit visualization system. As the sub-project leader, I was responsible for overall scheme design, software development, and project management.

## Key Contributions

### Code Rule Checking

Successfully developed a **code rule checker** for VHDL and Verilog that:

- Validates syntax and semantic correctness
- Detects common coding errors and violations
- Provides detailed error reports with code locations

### Circuit Visualization

Implemented an advanced **circuit visualization system** that solves the critical "code-to-circuit" traceability problem:

- **DAG-based Analysis:** Utilized **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) topological sorting** to analyze circuit structure
- **Automatic Layout:** Developed automatic layout algorithms for circuit diagram generation
- **Real-time Rendering:** Achieved real-time rendering and visualization of logic circuit diagrams corresponding to violating code segments
- **Traceability:** Enables developers to visually understand how code translates to hardware circuits

## Technical Highlights

The system combines:

- **Compiler principles** for parsing and analyzing hardware description languages
- **Graph algorithms** for circuit structure analysis and visualization
- **Software engineering** practices for robust system design and implementation

## Impact

This project significantly improves the development workflow for FPGA designers by providing immediate visual feedback on code-to-circuit mapping, reducing debugging time and improving code quality in hardware design projects.
