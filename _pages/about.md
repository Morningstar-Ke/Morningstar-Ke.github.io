I am currently a Master’s student in Biology and Medicine at Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), where I am fortunate to be advised by [Advisor Name, if applicable]. Prior to this, I received my B.Eng. degree in Software Engineering from Dalian University of Technology (DUT) in 2023, graduating with a major GPA of 3.65/4.0.

My research interests lie at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Neuroscience, with a specific focus on Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) and Neural Decoding. I am driven by the goal of bridging the gap between biological and machine intelligence. My solid background in software engineering allows me to efficiently design and implement complex deep learning architectures for high-dimensional brain signal processing.

Currently, I am working on neuroscience-inspired frameworks for the tri-modality alignment of brain signals, vision, and language. My work aims to solve the "feature-physiological mismatch" in rapid visual decoding by simulating the human visual system's dual-stream mechanism.

I am always open to discussions and collaborations. Please feel free to reach out via email.
